          Hello, I'm Shubham, and I'm from the town of Buxar in Bihar. I've had a journey in education that's been full of hard work and success.<br>
          I started my schooling at Netarhat Residential School in the beautiful Netarhat plateau of Jharkhand. Getting into this school was a big achievement for me; I earned a place in the top 100 students in the Jharkhand state entrance test. I did really well in my 10th-grade exams and scored an impressive 88.2% under the Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC).
          <br><br>
          After finishing my 10th grade, I continued my studies at Government D.K. College, Dumraon, in Buxar district. There, I kept up my good grades, scoring 84.2% in my 12th-grade exams under the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB).
          <br><br>
          When it came time to choose my college, I secured an All India Rank of 636 in the VITEEE entrance exam. This impressive rank allowed me to pursue my passion for computer science, and I was granted admission to VIT, Vellore.
          <br><br>
          I have completed my graduation as a computer science student at VIT, Vellore. I'm really passionate about technology, and I understand how important it is in our world today. During my time in college, I've been involved in various tech projects that have helped me learn and grow. I believe that computer science has the power to change the world, and I'm excited to be part of that.
          <br><br>
          I'm a hardworking person who's dedicated to my studies. I'm also grateful for the scholarships I've received, like the Temenos India Private Limited Scholarship(2022-2024) and the Bihar Government Scholarship (2020-2022). These scholarships show that my efforts in my field of study are paying off.
          <br><br>
          Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. I'm looking forward to the future and the opportunities it brings in the world of computer science.
